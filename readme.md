# Using Braces in Conitionals

I got the following question from a student: "For an if statement, when do we and donâ€™t put the brackets around the statement?"  
  
In short, you need braces when you have more than one statement to process in your if condition. Let's look at some examples.  

## If Condition with One Statement 

```csharp
  double myPay, myBills, raiseAmount;
  myPay = 500.00;
  myBills = 750.00;
  if (myPay < myBills)
      WriteLine("I need a raise!");
```

Here is a flowchart representing the above code:  

<!-- below from https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid -->
```mermaid
flowchart TB
A["Declare #quot;double myPay, myBills, raiseAmount double variables #quot"] 
A --> B[Set myPay = 500.00 and myBills = 750.00];
B --> C{Is myPay less than myBills? Yes!};
C --> |Yes| D["WriteLine  #quot;I need a raise!#quot; "];
```
Console output:

```txt
I need a raise!
```

However, in my view, I think braces should be used at all times as this is more readable:

```csharp
double myPay, myBills;
myPay = 500.00;
myBills = 750.00;
if (myPay < myBills)
{
    WriteLine("I need a raise!");
}
```

## If Condition with More Than One Statement `NOT` Using Braces

```csharp
  //If you have multiple statements, then braces are needed as the initial semicolon terminates the statement:
  myPay = 1000.00;
  myBills = 750.00;
  if (myPay < myBills)
    WriteLine("I need a raise!");
  //the next 2 statements below should not be executed as the pay is more than the bills, however
  //the semicolon at the end of the WriteLine above terminates the if statement and the WriteLine
  //below will always be displayed, even when logically it should not.
  raiseAmount = myBills - myPay;
  WriteLine("My raise amount: {0}...It's negative! Not a reduction please!!", raiseAmount.ToString("C"));
```

```mermaid
flowchart TB
A[Set myPay = 1000.00 and myBills = 750.00];
A --> B{Is myPay less than myBills? No.};
B --> |Yes| C["WriteLine  #quot;I need a raise!#quot; "];
B --> |No| D[Set raiseAmount = myBills - myPay];
C --> D[Set raiseAmount = myBills - myPay];
D --> E["WriteLine &quot;My raise amount: ($250.00)...It's negative! Not a reduction please!!&quot;"];
```

Console output:

```txt
My raise amount: ($250.00)...It's negative! Not a reduction please!!
```

## If Condition with More Than One Statement Using Braces

```csharp
  //As you can see below, the brakets group multiple statements in a logical unit, in 
  //spite of the semicolons terminiating each statement.
  myPay = 500.00;
  myBills = 750.00;
  if (myPay < myBills)
  {
      WriteLine("I need a raise!");
      raiseAmount = myBills - myPay;
      WriteLine("My raise amount: {0}", raiseAmount.ToString("C"));
  }
```

```mermaid
flowchart TB
A[Set myPay = 500.00 and myBills = 750.00];
A --> B{Is myPay less than myBills? Yes!};
B --> |Yes| C["WriteLine  #quot;I need a raise!#quot; "];
B --> |No| F[Continue on];
C --> D[Set raiseAmount = myBills - myPay];
D --> E["WriteLine &quot;My raise amount: $250.00&quot;"];
```

Console output:

```txt
I need a raise!
My raise amount: $250.00
```

## Another If Condition with More Than One Statement Using Braces

```chsharp
  //Now, none of the statements will be executed in the if condition
  myPay = 1000.00;
  myBills = 750.00;
  if (myPay < myBills)
  {
      WriteLine("I need a raise!");
      raiseAmount = myBills - myPay;
      WriteLine("My raise amount: {0}", raiseAmount.ToString("C"));
  }
```

```mermaid
flowchart TB
A[Set myPay = 1000.00 and myBills = 750.00];
A --> B{Is myPay less than myBills? No.};
B --> |Yes| C["WriteLine  #quot;I need a raise!#quot; "];
B --> |No| F[Continue on];
C --> D[Set raiseAmount = myBills - myPay];
D --> E["WriteLine &quot;My raise amount: $250.00&quot;"];
```

For the above, there is no console output as no WriteLine functions were called.
